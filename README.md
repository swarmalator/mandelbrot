# Mandelbrot Set Generator

Computes and displays the mandelbrot set given a specific resolution,
max iterations, and color scheme.

## Compile (Gradle)

1. Download and extract anywhere
2. Open a terminal window in the directory with the gradle.build script
3. Type: gradle build run

## Instructions

Select the resolution (in pixels per 1 unit on the graph) and the maximum number
of iterations to test for divergence at each point. The user may choose between
plain white, grayscale, and colored shading schemes.

## Keyboard Input

R => edit resolution

M => edit max iterations

UP => increment value

DOWN => decrement value

C => toggle color

A => toggle grayscale
